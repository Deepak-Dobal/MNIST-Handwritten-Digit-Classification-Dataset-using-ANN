# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Dataset-using-ANN

# Problem Statement
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this demo, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of thousands of handwritten images.

#Tasks to be Performed
In this tutorial you will be performing the following tasks:

1-Prepare the dataset for the model 
2=Install Tensorflow 2.x
3-Develop Single Layer Perceptron model for classifying the handwritten digits
4-Plot the change in accuracy per epochs
5-Evaluate the model on the testing data
6-Analyse the model summary
7-Add hidden layer to the model to make it Multi-Layer Perceptron
8-Add Dropout to prevent overfitting and check its effect on accuracy
9-Increasing the number of Hidden Layer neuron and check its effect on accuracy
10-Use different optimizers and check its effect on accuracy
11-Increase the hidden layers and check its effect on accuracy
12-Manipulate the batch_size and epochs and check its effect on accuracy
13-Answer: What parameters should be choosen to get best accuracy on classifying the handwritten digits?

# Dataset Description
The MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, 
indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.
